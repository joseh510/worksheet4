Do you think the mean helpfulness value may differ significantly between different  customers or products?

I do think the mean helpfulness value may differ significantly between different customers or products depending on how helpful the customers review or how popular the product is. 

With the 3 Cusomter IDs I chose I calculated mean helpfulness values of 2,5, and 1. I think this is somwhat significant. 

And with the 3 product IDs I chose I calculated mean helpfulness values of 1.5, 3.66142, and 2. 
I find it interesing that the helpfulness values are lower for the Products IDs than the Customer IDs.
